# RL.NET
A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. 

There are two basic concepts in reinforcement learning: the environment (namely, the outside world) and the agent (namely, the algorithm you are writing). The agent sends actions to the environment, and the environment replies with observations and rewards (that is, a score).
